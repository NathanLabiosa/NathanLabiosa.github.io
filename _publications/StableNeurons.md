This paper introduces **stabilization adapters**â€”lightweight plug-in modules that can be added to frame-based vision networks to achieve **temporal stability and robustness to adversarial attacks** in video pipelines.  

Key results:  
- **+11.8% accuracy improvement** under iterative attacks without retraining base models  
- High performance on corruption-heavy datasets  
- **40% reduction in fine-tuning time** with modular implants  

We also propose a unified loss function for training both **temporal stability** and **robustness**, helping bridge the gap between static image classification and dynamic real-world video scenarios.
