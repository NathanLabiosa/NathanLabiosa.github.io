We present a **hybrid transformer architecture** designed for **protein family classification** and binding potential prediction. Our approach integrates sequence embeddings with learned biochemical features, achieving:  

- **15–25% performance improvement** over established baselines across **30 protein families**  
- A scalable pipeline for predicting other biocompatability metrics 
- Insights into machine learning and **model design** for bioinformatics workflows

This work advances **structure-informed transformer models** for biological sequence modeling, with applications in **drug discovery** and **proteomics research**.
