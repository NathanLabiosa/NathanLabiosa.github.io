This report investigates the integration of **visual features into large language models (VLLMs)**.  

Highlights:  
- Investivated model compressionfrom **65B to 7B parameters**
- Integrated **150k+ images** and **160k+ text samples** for multimodal training  
- Achieved **95% performance** of leading text-only LLMs in benchmark tasks
- Demonstrated practical deployment of VLLMs for **academic and research environments**  

This study provides a foundation for further investigation into **multimodal LLMs**.
